## The Basics

**My Mind** is all based in a technology called Markdown. If you nerd enough I can tell you Markdown is a Mark Up language that simplifies HTML. If you can't understand a single word of this definition, don't worry, you just need to use a couple of symbols to make fancy stuff appear on the screen. Check this link [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for this symbols.

## Emojis

You also can render emojis by default. It can be useful in some situations, once some of this emojis are more than simple smile faces. [Check here](https://github.com/caiyongji/emoji-list).

## Shields

If you find it useful you also can include this feature in your projects. You can get them [here](https://shields.io/)

## The Search Bar

You can use the search bar to find any project you have created. 
You can also use the same search bar to create a project. Type the desired project name and click the "Go button", as if you were searching for it.

## Deleting Projects

In order to delete a project, just delete all it's content and click the "Edit button".

## The Welcome Page

The **Welcome Page** Always will list your projects in an ordered list. So you can use this feature to easyli find your projects. Of course you also can use the search bar for this.

## Smart Links

You need to be creative to organize your projects. The smartest way is with internal links. Like I did with this document.
