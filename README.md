# My Mind
A self-hosted project management app. It's totally inspired on Notion, but with a few characteristics that you may like.

<!--**My Mind is:**

1. **Open Source**, because no company is better than the community.
2. **Locally Stored**, for the safety of your data (but remember to backup, please).
3. **A Markdown Reader**. So you cannot use that "/" commands from notion. Only Markdown. If you don't know how to use it here is a [quick guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) from Github. Don't cry, it's easy...
4. **Shareable**, I mean, you can share your projects with your team if you want to. The process is safe once your team would need an specific password (created by you) in order to access the shared pages. And if you don't want to share from your local machine (fair enough) you can deploy an instance of **My Mind** anywhere with just the projects you want to share.
